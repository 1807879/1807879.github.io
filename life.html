			<p>Covid-19 has, for those of us willing to follow guidelines, put a stop to most forms of social contact. With non-essential businesses unable to open many shops and social venues have faced financial hardship. But, where brick-and-mortar industries are failing, online services saw large growth thanks to the pandemic.</p>
			<p>At the start of lockdown, services such as Steam, an online video game storefront, saw a massive increase in online users, reaching 24 million online users in April of 2020 (SteamDB, 2021).</p>

			<p>Games featured on the Steam platform, as well as elsewhere, have also seen massive growth this year. March 20th, 2020 saw the release of <i>Doom Eternal</i> and <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i>, both of which saw record breaking digital sales in the first month at 3 million and 5 million units sold respectively (Valentine, 2020).</p>
			<p>For many, including myself, video games have provided a substitute for social interaction during the various quarantines. Where I have been unable to go to the park and drink with my friends, I have instead played a variety of video games with them. For me and my friends, many of the affordances offered by real world interaction are still available within virtual worlds.</p>
			<p><i>Grand Theft Auto Online</i> is an example of one of these virtual worlds. We can still talk and drink, albeit whilst sitting at our respective computers, but now we have the added benefit of driving around the fictional city of Los Santos.</p>
			<p>Of course, there are some obvious constraints with this approach to socialising. The most obvious is that our faces are reduced to in-game characters. Although we are given the ability to design our characters, the tools provided often come with their own limitations. My own character looks like a ginger Tilda Swinton, a person I wish I were as cool as.</p>
			<p>Something also must be said about the sedentary nature of video games. According to the NHS, observational studies have 'shown an association between sitting and ill health’ (NHS, 2019). Although we may be running around and shooting each other in Los Santos, our real-world bodies are taking the much worse beating of sitting still.</p>
			<p>Talking about exercise, we have yet to find a way of having sex in <i>Grand Theft Auto Online</i>. Certain non-player characters may play the role of sex workers but watching them bounce on my non-existent virtual genitals is not the same as meeting someone and inviting them around.</p>
			<p>Overall, games like <i>Grand Theft Auto Online</i> have provided some form of social interaction during this pandemic. The multiplayer aspect of these games can provide a source of entertainment not necessarily possible in the real world. However, like all social media, it has its shortcomings.</p>
