			<p>In 1906 John Philip Sousa wrote an essay titled ‘The Menace of Mechanical Music’. In it he described his fears that recordings of music and self-playing instruments would become a ‘substitute for human skill, intelligence, and soul’. His cultureless vision of the future, which we can laugh at with a century of hindsight, did not come to pass. Modern technology has provided us with a greater means to not just listen to music but also create it.</p>
			<p>There is, perhaps, a parallel between Sousa’s musical anxieties and certain modern linguistic ones. John Humphry’s ‘I h8 txt msgs’, an opinion piece masquerading as an article within the pseudo-newspaper the Daily Mail, reads similarly to Sousa’s work. Where Sousa describes the 'living, breathing example’ of music to be most ‘valuable to the student’, Humphry describes the act of finding a word in the dictionary a ‘small voyage of discovery - infinitely more satisfying than looking something up on the internet’. Where Sousa is afraid that children will imitate machines and ‘become simply human phonographs -- without soul or expression’, Humphry is scared that young people will inherit a language made of ‘ridiculous emoticons and everchanging abbreviations’.</p>
			<p>Both Sousa and Humphry have this romantic view of how things were, and both believe that the things to come will only destroy what they believe to be the correct social order. Put simply, they are both participating in a form of moral panic. Neither Sousa’s nor Humphry’s visions have come true. Just as mechanical machines have not replaced human skill, text speech is not, as Humphry phrases it, ‘raping our vocabulary’.</p>
			<p>Of course, Sousa still recognises some value in the ‘mechanical menace’, citing how ‘the best of these machines supply a certain amount of satisfaction and pleasure’. Meanwhile, Humphry comes across as finding the effects of technology on language to be completely abhorrent. However, his fears are unfounded. As Caroline Tagg claims, when writing about the relationship between technology and language, ‘people are perfectly able to change their style depending on the context’.</p>
			<p>So why is Humphry so concerned with drawing attention to this non-issue? Why does Humphry describe text speech as ‘pillaging’, ‘savaging’, and ‘raping’ the English Language? What value is there in a famously right-wing newspaper to publish an opinion piece which is designed to draw the attention of, and rile, a large demographic of reactionaries? Money. Specifically, money through ad revenue.</p>

			<p>In their book <i>Manufacturing Consent</i>, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky created a propaganda model which describes five editorial filters. Of these, the second is how newspapers must conform to the desires of their advertisers. If a newspaper lacks readership, then the value of the advertising space decreases.</p>
			<p>When it comes to fears that technology and smartphones are affecting language it is best to examine who is making these claims. The reality is that publishers like the Daily Mail are creating these articles to create a moral panic. A panic that drives people to click, share, and talk about their newspaper. A panic that will increase the value of their ad space.</p>
