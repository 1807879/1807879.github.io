			<p>In the 1991 episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation titled ‘Darmok’, the crew of the Enterprise attempt to open diplomatic communications with an alien civilisation known as the Children of Tama. The universal translator, a fictional device within the fiction of Star Trek, can translate the Tamarian language into English. However, the translator cannot decipher the meaning behind their words. ‘Shake, when the walls fell’ makes perfect sense as a sentence in English, but its meaning is lost. Eventually it is revealed that the Tamarian language uses imagery based on their own culture. ‘Shaka’, a city, ‘when the walls fell’ is a reference to a great failure. The episode suggests an example of imagery from our own culture with ‘Juliet on the balcony’ as a symbol of romance.</p>
			<p>Our own language is not void of imagery. Writers will often use it to enrich their own works, often at the risk of creating purple prose. However, what makes Darmok such an interesting episode is that the Tamarian language is entirely built around imagery. This relationship between cultural imagery and language is not too dissimilar to the language of memes. Among certain online communities the phrase ‘PogChamp’, as well as its derivatives ‘Pogs’ and ‘Poggers’, is an expression of excitement. Meanwhile, ‘Press F to pay respects’, or simply typing ‘F’, shares a similar meaning to the Tamarian ‘Shaka’, though F’s imagery includes both failure and death.</p>
			<p>I am not the first to make this connection. One of the top posts on the subreddit /r/DaystromInstitute, a board for discussing Star Trek in detail, is about this exact connection. Within the comments of that post, a user states that ‘people post that realisation pretty much every other week’. However, I believe there is another parallel to be drawn between communicating with imagery and online political discourse.</p>
			<p>Reddit, like many social media platforms, is made up of different communities each with their own niches. A sizable number of these communities are dedicated to the creation and sharing of memes. The subreddit /r/risa, for example is dedicated to memes relating to Star Trek. Browsing the subreddit by its top posts reveals its user base to lean left-wing politically. The imagery of Star Trek, such as the fascist Cardassians, are repurposed to highlight modern issues from a leftist perspective.</p>

			<p>There is another aspect to the use of imagery in political memes. Memes, just like the Tamarian language, rely on the reader to understand the meaning behind the imagery. The recently banned /r/SuperStraight subreddit was built around the idea that not wanting to have sex with a trans person made straight people the subject of prejudice. The use of memes in the subreddit mimicked that of LGBT communities, focusing on their sense of togetherness through societal prejudice. Of course, the real purpose of the subreddit was to divide the LGB community from the Trans community. Their memes, although not immediately clear to the average person, created a clear image for trans people and transphobes; the idea that trans people are scum.</p>
			<p>The imagery, and associated emotions, with which memes call upon are used on social media, within and outside of Reddit, to spread political messages. Whilst I doubt our own language will become as culturally complex as the Tamarians, I do see politics learning to fully embrace the nature of memetic language.</p>
